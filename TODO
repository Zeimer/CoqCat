2. Define slice categories (possibly using records). https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Category_Theory/Categories#Identities_for_Free_Categories
3. Write some simplyfying tactics for Pros, Sgr and Monoids.
4. Make an attempt at a general categorical tactic that could do something useful.
5. Fix Dual and Functor incompatibility.
6. Change uniqueness theorems to "unique up to unique isomorphism".
10. Refactor Monads.v: move the Maybe monad to CoqSet.
11. Define concrecete categories and use them for theorems about individual categories.
12. Define monoidal categories.
13. State and prove duality facts.
15. Define the divisibility poset.
16. START USING SETOIDS (or not).

Newer todos:
1. Divide the whole development into old (using parametrized Cat and Functor) and new (using the bare, unparametrized classes).
2. Paste and adjust code from the old to the new development.
3. Maybe move the dual instance right into CatAlternative? If so, rework the proofs to use duality.
