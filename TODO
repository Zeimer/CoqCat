Commit : proved theorems about mono- and epi- composition, defined coercions between Cat and BareCat, renamed BareCat to Cat', proved terminal and zero objects to be unique up to unique isomorphism, partially refactored CatInstances into single files, renamed categories Type and Sets to CoqType and CoqSet respectively.
