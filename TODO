1. Define coercions between Cat and BareCat.
2. Define slice categories (possibly using records). https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Category_Theory/Categories#Identities_for_Free_Categories
3. Write some simplyfying tactics for Pros, Sgr and Monoids.
4. Make an attempt at a general categorical tactic that could solve anything useful.
5. Fix Dual and Functor icompatibility.
6. Change uniqueness theorems to "unique up to unique isomorphism".
7. Refactor CatInstances into a directory of single files.
8. Rename category Sets to CoqSet.
9. Define category of sets and relations.
10. Refactor Monads.v: move the Maybe monad to CoqSet.
11. Define concrecete categories and use them for theorems about individual categories.
12. Define monoidal categories.
13. State and prove duality facts.

Commit : defined initial and terminal category, proved some characterizations for mono- and epimorphisms, first attempt at defining slice categories, updated this TODO, defined Sgr and Monoid instance for Z with addition and multiplication. Tried to prove there's a non-surjective monoid epimorphism between NatMult and ZMult, but failed, proved that initial object is unique up to unique isomorphism, proved that iso is sec + epi / mon + ret.
