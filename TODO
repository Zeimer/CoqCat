Branch: IndefiniteDescription

Fix:
1. Fix duality proofs. Currently I'm using an axiom.
3. Write new unique ismorphicness theorems (the isos have to be compatible with the projections).
6. Refactor Monads.v: move the Maybe monad to CoqSet.

General:
1. Implement a tactic to decide equality of morphisms based on a tactic that decides whether two elements of a monoid are equal (was it described in Coq'Art?). This will be very hard, but fruitful.
3. Implement concrecete categories and use them for theorems about individual categories.
4. Implement better pullbacks and pushouts.
6. Implement limits and colimits.
7. Implement monoidal categories.
8. Implement enriched categories.
9. Implement some examples of functors (like the Hom functor).

Instances:
2. Define slice categories: https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Category_Theory/Categories#Identities_for_Free_Categories
3. Define linear orders.
4. There's a problem: is lexicographic order even a proset?

Remarks:
1. Looks like Apartoid should have coequalizers, but CoqSet shouldn't.
