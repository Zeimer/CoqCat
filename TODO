2. Define slice categories (possibly using records). https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Category_Theory/Categories#Identities_for_Free_Categories
3. Write some simplyfying tactics for Pros, Sgr and Monoids.
4. Make an attempt at a general categorical tactic that could do something useful.
5. Fix Dual and Functor incompatibility.
6. Change uniqueness theorems to "unique up to unique isomorphism".
10. Refactor Monads.v: move the Maybe monad to CoqSet.
11. Define concrecete categories and use them for theorems about individual categories.
12. Define monoidal categories.
13. State and prove duality facts.
15. Define the divisibility poset.
16. START USING SETOIDS.

Commit : wrote some functor tactics (they work mainly for the old functor implementation), proved that taking opposie category is involutive, proved that coproduct commutes using duality.
